# Loop mode — autonomous issue → PR reconciler

Enter this mode **only** when the user explicitly asks to loop through and fix
issues (e.g. "loop through the issues and fix them", "auto-fix issues"). In this
mode the skill's "Do NOT auto-branch / auto-fix" guardrails are overridden —
auto-branching and fixing *is* the requested intent.

**The model is a reconciler, not a pipeline.** Each tick you first drive *every*
PR/issue you already own one step toward `merged`, and only *then* admit new work
— and only while you're under the WIP limit. State lives in GitHub + ShipFlow
(labels, claims, PR/CI/review status), not in your head, so a stopped loop just
re-reads `inbox --json` and resumes.

**You are an orchestrator; the work runs in subagents.** You (the main session)
stay thin — read compact JSON, dispatch, collect a one-paragraph structured
return. Each issue/PR is handled by a **fresh-context subagent** (the Task tool),
so context never bloats across many items and issues can't cross-contaminate. And
**every issue and every PR passes through the reviewer first** — a subagent that
pulls ShipFlow's feature map for a whole-system view before any fix ships. See the
Roles section.

## Setup — run in a worktree (once, before the cycle)

The loop **always** works in a git worktree, never in the user's live checkout.
Use a **single** worktree, reused for every iteration (not one per issue):

- Prefer the `EnterWorktree` tool with a fixed name (`shipflow-loop`); it creates
  the worktree off the default branch and switches into it. Fall back to
  `git worktree add .worktrees/shipflow-loop -b shipflow-loop/base origin/<default>`
  (ensure `.worktrees/` is gitignored) and `cd` into it.
- If already in that worktree (resuming), reuse it — don't create another.
- All branching, fixing, testing, committing, pushing happen inside this one
  worktree. **Cleanup:** merged `fix/issue-*` branches are pruned automatically
  at merge time by `pr automerge`/`pr merge` (remote via gh `--delete-branch`,
  local via a force-prune that detaches HEAD if the worktree is on the branch).
  At run end — only once no PRs you own are still in flight — tear the worktree
  down: `ExitWorktree`, else `cd` out and `git worktree remove
  .worktrees/shipflow-loop` + `git branch -D shipflow-loop/base`. Surface its
  path + branch first; keep it if you're only pausing/resuming.

**Preflight — test baseline (once).** The loop enforces a test bar, so it needs one
to exist. If the repo has **no test framework** (no `*.config`, no `test/`/`spec/`),
dispatch a worker to bootstrap one before the cycle: research the right framework for
the stack, install it, write 3–5 real tests for the most-changed files, wire a CI
workflow, commit `chore: bootstrap test framework`. Skip if tests already exist or the
user opted out. Without this, an untested greenfield repo has nothing for the worker's
regression tests or the reviewer's CI gate to stand on.

## Policies — the three knobs (set once, then trust them)

How far the loop drives a PR without a human is configured, not hard-coded.
Read them with `renaiss-shipflow config list`; set with `config set <key> <v>`
(env vars `SHIPFLOW_*` override):

| Knob | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `merge-policy` | `manual` | `manual` = never auto-merge (park for a human) · `auto-on-green` = merge when CI green **and** approved · `auto-timeout` = green + no objection past `stale-pr-hours` |
| `require-ci` | `true` | CI must be green before a PR is "advanced" / merged |
| `max-fix-attempts` | `3` | CI-fix tries on one PR before escalating to a human |
| `wip-limit` | `10` | max open PRs you own before you stop admitting new work |
| `stale-pr-hours` | `48` | a green, unreviewed PR older than this is `stale` → ping/escalate |
| `bug-hunt` | `true` | when the queue is empty, run a test+QA sweep and file issues for bugs found (Phase C) |
| `bug-hunt-cap` | `5` | max NEW issues the bug sweep may file per run |
| `require-review` | `true` | route every issue (intake) and PR (pre-merge) through the reviewer subagent first |

The real merge guard is the repo's **GitHub branch protection** — even `auto-on-green`
can't merge what GitHub blocks. Approval = a GitHub review approval **or** the
`shipflow-approved` label — which is exactly what the **reviewer** adds via
`renaiss-shipflow pr approve <n>`. So the reviewer's verdict *is* the merge gate.

## Roles — three subagents the orchestrator dispatches

Dispatch each via the **Task tool**. Each gets a fresh context and returns a
compact payload; their heavy work (reading code, diffs, test output) never enters
your context.

- **orchestrator** = you, the main session. Read compact JSON (`inbox`,
  `issue next`, `features`, subagent returns), decide, dispatch, count vs `cap`.
  **Never read source files or diffs yourself** — that keeps your context flat
  across the whole run.
- **reviewer** — the mandatory gate (`require-review`, default on). Pulls
  `renaiss-shipflow features --json` (ShipFlow's feature map) for a whole-system
  view, then reviews an **issue at intake** (validate, map to features, write an
  acceptance brief) and a **PR before merge** (cross-feature impact, regressions,
  meets the brief; approves with `pr approve`). Contract + schema:
  `references/loop-reviewer.md`.
- **worker** — fixes ONE issue end-to-end (branch → fix → test → PR → evidence) in
  its own context, returns `{pr, verified, blocked}`. Also runs reconcile fixes
  (CI, review feedback, rebase). Contract: `references/loop-worker.md`.

## The cycle — each tick

### A. Reconcile in-flight work — dispatch a worker per item

Run `renaiss-shipflow inbox --json` (compact — this is all *you* read). For each PR
whose `state` needs action, **dispatch a worker subagent** (Task tool) scoped to
that one PR and collect its return. Loop A until nothing in-flight `needsAttention`:

- `ci_failing` → worker fixes the failing checks (`gh pr checks <n>`) on the branch
  and pushes. Track attempts across ticks; after `max-fix-attempts` still red →
  `renaiss-shipflow issue escalate <issue> --reason "CI red after N attempts: …"`.
- `changes_requested` / `review_comments` → worker addresses every comment —
  **including async external bot reviewers** (gemini-code-assist, coderabbit); list
  them with `renaiss-shipflow pr reviews <n> --json`, fix each, push, reply, and
  **resolve the thread** (`pr resolve <n> --thread <id>`). Then **re-dispatch the
  reviewer** (the gate re-runs after any change). Ambiguous/conflicting → escalate.
- `approved_ready` → the reviewer already added `shipflow-approved` (Phase B step 4)
  → `renaiss-shipflow pr automerge <n> --json` (merges only if `merge-policy` + CI +
  approval allow **and no review thread is unresolved**; parks on `manual`). The
  unresolved-thread block is a hard gate — an approved PR with an open bot comment
  will not merge.
- conflict → worker runs `renaiss-shipflow pr sync <n>` on the branch (exit 6 =
  unresolved → escalate).
- `stale` → nudge once / escalate if blocked. `ci_pending` / `awaiting_review` →
  **parked, no action** (re-checked next tick; don't busy-wait).

A PR becomes `approved_ready` **only** because the reviewer approved it — never
hand-add `shipflow-approved`. For each in-progress issue with a `newComment`, a
worker reads + acts. **A human reply on a `needs-human` issue** — a new comment from
a person, i.e. not one of the loop's own `🚧 **Needs a human**` / evidence comments —
is the **decision that unblocks it**: remove the `needs-human` label, bake the
human's guidance into the acceptance brief as a settled decision, and hand it
straight to a worker (Phase B step 3); the reviewer then gates the resulting PR
(step 4). Do **not** re-run the intake validity gate or re-escalate the question the
human just answered. (A reply that's only a question/chatter with no decision stays
escalated.)

### B. Admit new work — under the WIP limit, every issue reviewed first

If (open PRs you own) ≥ `wip-limit`, **skip B** (drain A instead). Otherwise, while
PRs-opened-this-run < `cap`, admit ONE issue — each step a fresh subagent:

1. **Pick** — `renaiss-shipflow issue next --json` (claims next open/unclaimed,
   priority → severity → newest; optional `--label bug`; skips `needs-human`/claimed).
   **Exit 4** / `issue: null` → nothing to admit.
   - **Dependency check:** blocked-by / depends-on an unmerged `#X` →
     `renaiss-shipflow issue escalate <n> --reason "blocked by #X"` and pick the next.
2. **Reviewer — intake** (mandatory; `require-review`). Dispatch the reviewer
   subagent with the issue + triage. It pulls `renaiss-shipflow features --json`,
   validates the issue, maps it to the features it touches, and returns an
   **acceptance brief** (what "done" means + which features to regression-check).
   Reviewer rejects (invalid / duplicate / needs a human) → `issue escalate` and
   pick the next. See `references/loop-reviewer.md`.
3. **Worker — fix** Dispatch the worker subagent with the issue + triage + brief.
   It pulls the **feature map** itself (`features --json`) for file boundaries +
   neighbouring features, so the heavy data stays in its context, not yours. In
   the loop worktree it: branches (`fix/issue-<n>-<slug>` off `origin/<default>`),
   fixes, runs project tests **and** a diff-scoped E2E browser pass with before/after
   screenshots + a **health score** (`references/browser-testing.md`), **adds a
   regression test** for the bug, opens the PR with `renaiss-shipflow pr create --json`
   (which **links the issue via `Closes #N`** — a reference, not a copy of the issue),
   and attaches evidence with the health delta (`issue evidence <n> --pr <pr> --file …`).
   Returns `{pr, verified, regressionTest, healthDelta, blocked}`. Unverified/blocked
   → `issue escalate`, no PR.
4. **Reviewer — PR review** (mandatory). Dispatch the reviewer on the new PR with
   the brief. It first checks **external reviews** (`renaiss-shipflow pr reviews <n>
   --json` — unresolved threads incl. bot reviewers), then pulls `features --json` +
   the diff for a **whole-system review** (cross-feature impact, regressions, meets
   the brief), posts the review, and verdicts:
   - **approve** — only with **no unresolved review threads**, brief met, CI green →
     `renaiss-shipflow pr approve <pr> --comment "<summary>"` (adds `shipflow-approved`;
     it refuses, exit 7, if any thread is still open). Now `approved_ready` for A.
   - **request changes** → list every fix incl. each external thread; re-dispatch a
     worker to fix + `pr resolve` the threads, then re-review. Never approve until
     all threads are resolved. External reviewers are async — if none have posted
     yet, leave the PR parked; A's next tick catches the late review.

Do **not** `issue done` here — the claim stays until the PR merges (A's automerge
releases it), keeping the issue out of `issue next` while its PR is in flight.

### C. Bug sweep — when there's nothing left to fix, hunt for new bugs

When B's `issue next` returns exit 4 / `issue: null` **and** A is clean (no PR
needs action), don't stop yet. If `bug-hunt` is on (`config get bug-hunt`, default
**true**), turn the idle time into QA that *refills* the queue:

1. **Sweep methodically** (dispatch a QA subagent so its output stays out of your
   context) — run `renaiss-shipflow test` and `renaiss-shipflow regression --json`,
   then a real-browser QA sweep. Use `renaiss-shipflow features --json` to prioritise
   `high` `test_priority` features, and run the **per-page checklist** on each
   (`references/bug-taxonomy.md` §4: click everything, fill forms, check empty/error
   states, console after each interaction, responsive, auth boundaries). Compute the
   **health score** and diff it against the stored baseline (`references/qa-report.md`)
   — a score drop since last sweep means something regressed. Screenshot anything broken.
2. **File genuine bugs as issues** — for each bug you can **actually reproduce**
   (retry once to confirm), classified with a **severity + category** from the
   taxonomy, and not already an open issue (dedupe via `renaiss-shipflow issues list
   --json` — match by title/area; skip anything labelled `auto-qa` you already filed):
   `renaiss-shipflow issue create --title "<bug>" --body "<repro + expected vs actual>"
   --label bug --label auto-qa --label "severity:<…>" --label "area:<…>" --json`
   (`bug-taxonomy.md` §3). Attach evidence with `issue evidence <n> --file <shot>`,
   and update the baseline. **Only file what you reproduced** — no speculative or
   duplicate issues.
3. **Feed the loop**: if the sweep filed ≥1 new issue → **go back to A** (the loop
   now fixes the bugs it just found). If it found **nothing new** (clean, or only
   dupes) → *that's* the real stop.

Bound it: file at most `bug-hunt-cap` new issues per run (default 5); the PR `cap`
still applies to fixes. Turn it off with `config set bug-hunt false` (or
`SHIPFLOW_BUG_HUNT=false`) — then an empty queue just stops.

### D. Repeat / stop

Loop A→B→C. The run ends only when PRs-opened-this-run has hit `cap`, **or** the
queue is empty AND the bug sweep (C) surfaced nothing new (or `bug-hunt` is off).
`cap` precedence: a `cap=N` token the user passed (`cap=all` drains the queue),
else `SHIPFLOW_LOOP_CAP`, else **5**.

## Reconcile playbook (inbox `state` → action)

| `state` | What it means | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `ci_failing` | a check is red | fix on branch, push; escalate after `max-fix-attempts` |
| `changes_requested` | reviewer wants changes | pr-feedback → fix → push → reply |
| `review_comments` | unaddressed comments | pr-feedback (may already be handled) → reply |
| `ci_pending` | checks running | park — re-check next tick |
| `approved_ready` | approved + CI green | `pr automerge` (parks on `manual`) |
| `stale` | green, unreviewed, old | nudge the PR; escalate if blocked on a human |
| `awaiting_review` | green, no feedback yet | park |

## Guardrails

- **The reviewer gate is mandatory** (`require-review`): no worker starts an issue
  without an intake brief, and no PR is `approved_ready`/merged without the reviewer
  posting a review and running `pr approve`. The reviewer always pulls
  `features --json` first — it reviews against the whole system, not just the diff.
- **Orchestrator context discipline:** dispatch, don't do. You read only compact
  JSON and one-line subagent returns — never open source files, diffs, or test logs
  in the main session. That's what lets the loop run `cap=all` without context bloat.
- **Optional persistence:** the user can pair this loop with `/goal "drain the queue
  and merge everything mergeable"` so the orchestrator won't stop early — belt-and-
  suspenders on top of "run to the cap." `/goal` is an **orchestrator-only** tool —
  never put a stop-hook/goal inside a subagent; subagents must *return* (via their
  self-verify contract) for the loop to progress. Quality comes from the subagent's
  completion contract + the reviewer gate, not from blocking a subagent's return.
- **`pr automerge` is the only merge path the loop uses** — it self-gates on
  `merge-policy`. With the default `manual` it never merges; approved PRs pile up
  cleanly for a human. **Never** call bare `pr merge` or cut a `release` without
  explicit human confirmation.
- **Escalate, don't spin.** A single hard/blocked/unverifiable item →
  `issue escalate` (labels `needs-human`, keeps the claim, comments why) and move
  on. It never ends the run; you never pause mid-run to ask for direction.
  Write `--reason` to be **read by a human**, not as a dense paragraph: lead with
  a one-line TL;DR, then a few short bullets (what's blocked · what *was*
  decidable · the decision you need). `issue escalate` adds the heading + the
  "what happens next" footer around it — so just supply scannable markdown.
- Reconcile (A) acts only on **your own** PRs and claimed issues. Don't touch
  others' PRs/issues unless asked.
- Because blocked/escalated issues keep their claim and carry `needs-human`,
  `issue next` advances down the priority list. **A human reply on such an issue
  brings it back in** via Phase A — treat the reply as the decision, drop
  `needs-human`, and implement it; don't re-escalate the question they answered.
  When B's pick returns null **and** A is clean, the bug sweep (C) runs; the run
  ends only once C also comes up empty.
- **Bug sweep files real bugs only.** Phase C may only file an issue for a bug it
  **reproduced**, never a duplicate of an open issue, always labelled `auto-qa`,
  and at most `bug-hunt-cap` per run. It never files speculative/style nitpicks.
- **Self-regulate — WTF-likelihood.** Beyond the flat caps, watch a running signal
  that the loop is thrashing. Start at 0%; add +15% per revert, +20% when a fix
  touches files unrelated to its issue, +5% per fix touching >3 files, +10% if all
  that's left is `low` severity. **Above ~20% → stop and summarize** instead of
  pressing on; a high revert rate or unrelated-file churn means the loop is guessing.
  This is a smarter brake than `max-fix-attempts` alone, which only counts retries on
  one PR.
- **Health gate on merge.** A PR whose evidence shows a **negative health delta**
  (`references/qa-report.md`) is treated like an unresolved thread: the reviewer
  won't approve it and `pr automerge` won't merge it, regardless of `merge-policy`.
- **At the cap or an empty queue:** summarize — PRs opened, merged (if policy
  allowed), parked-awaiting-review, and escalated (with reasons) — then ask
  whether to continue beyond the cap, raise the merge policy, or merge anything by
  hand. Releasing escalated claims and any `pr merge`/`release` still need explicit
  confirmation. (That "ask" applies only to a `once`/single-pass run; **by default
  the loop is continuous** — don't ask, post the one-line summary and end the turn,
  leaving the recurring trigger to resume the next pass after its dormancy.)
- **Continuous mode (default).** `/shipflow-loop` keeps the loop running: one full
  pass, then **dormant ~15 min**, then another pass, indefinitely — so new issues /
  PR-CI changes are picked up without re-invoking. At the start of the run, create a
  recurring trigger (default every 15 min, an off-`:00`/`:30` minute) that re-fires
  `/shipflow-loop`, then run the first pass now; re-entry is idempotent (a tick sees
  the existing trigger and skips re-creating it, so they never stack), and each tick
  is an unattended pass that ends without asking (empty queue is fine — it keeps
  checking). `/shipflow-loop once` runs a single pass with no trigger; stop an active
  loop with `/shipflow-loop stop` (delete the trigger), then do the worktree cleanup.
  The trigger fires only while Claude Code is running/idle and may be session-scoped
  (cmux) with a ~7-day expiry; for a true always-on reconciler use an external
  scheduler (cron / launchd / GitHub Actions) driving `/shipflow-loop once`.
